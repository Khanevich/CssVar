# Update CSS Variables with JS

This task is from the challenge "30 projects in 30 days", in which I made `Simplest image editor` by vanilla JS.  You can use it for your own purposes.


### Quickstart
You can see the working UI/UX of this task by the link: https://khanevich.github.io/CssVar/

### Create a new project based on the CssVar
Clone this repo into new project folder (e.g., CssVar).
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/khanevich/CssVar CssVar
cd CssVar
